LDAP

This is a challenge to gauge your expertise with a number of technologies. 
Here is a link to a GitHub https://github.com/mieweb/linuxtest project that sets up a Linux virtual server on your machine.
Install an LDAP server within the virtual machine.  Consider changing the provision.sh to automatically install and configure the virtual machine. 
The LDAP server should use the LDAP database as the source of truth for identity management. Bonus points if you make the database backend SQL. 

Keep notes. Afterward, we will do a WebEx to discuss how you accomplished the task (steps you took), insights about the process, and issues.

- Changes to the provision files for vagrant are in linuxtest-master-ldap
- Config files are in the LDAP folder
      - This includes a txt file showing what commands I ran
      - Also includes all the files made for the config of LDAP
